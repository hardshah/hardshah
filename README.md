# Hi, Iâ€™m Hard Shah 

As a student at the University of Waterloo, I am looking to enhance my skills in web app development, and learn more technologies. I
am a passionate and aspiring developer. 

My current experiences lie in creating web apps with frameworks like flask and ASP.NET. I have a couple of projects where I use the MVC architecture to structure my app
as I find it works to help me create more modular code and lets me easily find parts that need to be revisited.

Currently the languages I am familiar with are: 

Python, C#, C++,Javascript, HTML5 and CSS.
