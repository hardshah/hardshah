# Hi, Iâ€™m Hard Shah 

As a student at the University of Waterloo, I am looking to enhance my skills in software development and create cool projects!

So far I've used Python, C#, C++, Javascript and Java.

Some of my projects, include a compiler for basic arithmetic expressions, an automated onboarding tool, a calendar app to keep track of appointments with clients and more.

Feel free to take a look at my repositories
